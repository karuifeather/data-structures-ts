# Data Structures

I finally delved (delving) into the world of Data Structures and algorithm.

I decided to use TS for my implementations. Pure JS is boring and unproductive and also I don't know Python or C++ enough to implement these DS in them.

## Following topics are DS covered (as of now):

- Linked List

  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubldy Linked List

- Stack

  - With Array
  - With Linked List

- Queue

  - With Array
  - With Linked List

- Trees
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Tree Traversal
