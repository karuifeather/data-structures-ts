# What is a Tree?

A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship

![Tree](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/images/tree_data_structure.jpg)

- Trees are non-linear data structures that contain a root and child nodes
- Binary Trees can have values of any type, but at most two children for each parent
- Binary Search Trees are a more specific version of binary trees where every node to the left of a parent is less than it's value and every node to the right is greater
- We can search through Trees using BFS and DFS

## What makes up a Tree?

- Root - The top node in a tree.
- Child -A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
- Parent - The converse notion of a child.
- Siblings -A group of nodes with the same parent.
- Leaf - A node with no children.
- Edge - The connection between one node and another.
