# TRAVERSING A TREE

**Two ways:**

- Breadth-first Search
- Depth-first Search

## BFS

- Create a queue (this can be an array) and a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Place the root node in the queue
- Loop as long as there is anything in the queue
  - Dequeue a node from the queue and push the value of the node into the variable that stores the nodes
  - If there is a left property on the node dequeued - add it to the queue
  - If there is a right property on the node dequeued - add it to the queue
- Return the variable that stores the values

## DFS - InOrder

Used commonly with BST's

Notice we get all nodes in the tree in their underlying order

- Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
- Write a helper function which accepts a node
  - If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
  - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
  - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
- Invoke the helper function with the current variable
- Return the array of values

## DFS - PreOrder

Can be used to "export" a tree structure so that it is easily reconstructed or copied.

- Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
- Write a helper function which accepts a node
  - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
  - If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
  - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
- Invoke the helper function with the current variable
- Return the array of values

## DFS - PostOrder

- Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
- Write a helper function which accepts a node
  - If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
  - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
  - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
    Invoke the helper function with the current variable
- Return the array of values
